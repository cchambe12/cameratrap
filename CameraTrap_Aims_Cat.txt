The Berkshire Wildlife Linkage: Camera Trap Project
2 January 2018 - started by Cat Chamberlain

The primary aim of this project is to efficiently and effectively process all camera trap data. The first objective is to find an interface, machine-learning tool or create new code to identify relevant images and remove superfluous data. The second objective is to design a method to process the remaining photos - ideally through a citizen science project. 

Timeline:
	1. End of January: Start by going through resources provided by Laura
 	   a) Learn about each method and write up the pros and cons
	   b) Test run with a sample set of data to measure accuracy 
	2. January: Reach out to Andy Wood to establish correspondence  
	3. February: Based on further research and possible suggestions from Andy 
	   a) reach out to other potential collaborators (i.e., UMass Amherst?)
	   b) determine if there are alternative/additional programs to investigate 
	4. End of February: settle on best approach and analyze data
	5. End of March: investigate Zooniverse.org or similar
	   a) for potential Citizen Science platform to process the remaining photos 
	6. April: work on implementing citizen science program and a training protocol
